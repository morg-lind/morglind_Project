The folder contains the codes and files that I used during the analysis process: 

- analysis_crime_data_sample.csv = The CSV file that contains the data that is prepped for analysis with top 100 rows due to storage capacity.
- final_crime_rates_sample.csv = The CSV file that contains the data after all analysis questions have been completed with top 100 rows due to storage capacity.
- morglind_analysis.ipynb = The code that performs the analysis with visualizes, tests, machine learning models, and time series.
