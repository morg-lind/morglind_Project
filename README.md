# morglind_Project

The first dataset is found at Data.gov: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present This dataset contains information about crimes committed from 2020 to the present. However, for the purposes of this project, we will only focus on data recorded in 2024 and 2025. To gather the additional data source, data scraping will be performed on this website https://www.laalmanac.com/population/po24la.php. This website provides demographic information for various communities across Los Angeles. The web scraping will extract each communityâ€™s population and ethnicity breakdown
