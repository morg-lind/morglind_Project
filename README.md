 # morglind_Project

> To provide comprehensive background knowledge regarding this project, two datasets will be used to present detailed information about the demographics of Los Angeles’s and the city’s crime rates across communities within the years of 2024 and 2025.

### Folders:
- Starting Project:
  - Includes the original csv files of each data set used, both from a scraped source and data set found online. Also includes the notebooks that contain the web scraping process and the integration of the two data sets.
- Codes:
  - Includes the notebooks that show how I cleaned the data sets and the analysis of my first 2 questions for the project. Could not upload the merged csv file that I worked from due to the storage size.
